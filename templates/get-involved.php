Anybody who programs in PHP can be a contributing member of the community that develops and deploys it; the task of deploying PHP, documentation and associated websites is a never ending one.<br />
With every release, or release candidate comes a wave of work, which takes a lot of organization and co-ordination.<br /> <br />

With the introduction of release managers comes a smoother release process, but help is still needed: testing release candidates, finding and squashing bugs in tests, documentation, and sources.<br /><br />

Someone hoping to become involved in the maintenance and development of the source should be experienced in all of the areas mentioned above, as this creates a strong team; everyone knows how every other part of the project works.<br /><br />

You will also need experience in C programming as PHP is written entirely in C.
